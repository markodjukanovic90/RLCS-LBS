# Accompanying Material for the Paper  
**"A Learning Search Algorithm for the Restricted Longest Common Subsequence Problem"**

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper _"A Learning Search Algorithm for the Restricted Longest Common Subsequence Problem"_, co-authored by **M. Djukanovic**, **J. Reixach**, **A. Nikolikj**, **A. Kartelj**, and **C. Blum**.

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`instances/`**  
Contains all problem instances used in the research. It includes two subdirectories:  
- **`RANDOM/`** â€“ randomly generated instances  
- **`ABSTRACT/`** â€“ real-world instances derived from abstract data

- **`binaries/`**  
Contains the binaries required to reproduce the experiments.  
ðŸ‘‰ Please refer to the **`ReadMe.txt`** file for detailed instructions on how to properly run the programs.

- **`results/`**  
Includes all results presented in the paper. This directory contains:  
- **`BS-vary/`** â€“ results for varying the value of the beta parameter in both **BS-prob** and **LBS** algorithms  
- **`results_aggregated/`** â€“ aggregated results  
- **`non-aggregated/`** â€“ detailed results for each individual search run

- **`ReadMe.txt`**  
A plain text file with complete instructions for setting up and executing the software.
